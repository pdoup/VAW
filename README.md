Predict Violence Against Women (VAW) using ML models

#### About the Dataset
```VAW.csv``` contains records collected from various international surveys concerning markers attached to violence against women cases. These records are obtained from 22 countries in the Pacific spanning accross a period of 13 years (2006-2019) and are provided via the [Pacific Data Hub](https://stats.pacificdata.org/) website. More info on the dataset can be found in the accompanying file [here](../VAW_info.pdf).

#### Our task
Study the dataset/preprocess and train ML algorithms to predict the target variable (Outcome) which refers to the impact that abusive behaviour has on women in the future. Outcome can be on of many labels thus this constitutes a Multi-Class classification problem. In a nutshell our goal is to:
1. Analyze the given dataset
2. Train ML models
3. Predict ***Outcome*** when that is not available
4. Present our final results/conclusions
